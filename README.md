# fitbit_cutomer_behavior

This code was created as capstone project for the Google data analytics course. 
All data is sourced from public data sets as outlined in the rmd file. 

It helped me explore different plotting techniques with R. 

tl;dr (project summary)
The main points concluded from the fitbit data (30 participants, one month):
- Most users log their steps/activity, some log their sleep, and only few users log weight consistantly 
- Steps but not sleep are significantly correlated with weekday
- High activity minutes but not steps are an indicator for hours slept 
- The amount of sedetary minutes per day does not influence the total step count, while high activity minutes have a strong influence 
- This study only included user who are sedetary during the majority of their day.
